  <p><strong>A blazing fast üöÄ, pure Swift implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</strong></p>
</div>

-----

**SwiftEVM** is a high-performance, open-source implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, 
written entirely in **Swift**. It‚Äôs designed to empower both developers and businesses by enabling 
seamless integration of Ethereum smart contract execution into a wide variety of applications.

Our focus is on:
- ‚ö° **Speed & Performance**: Critical paths are highly optimized for blazing-fast execution.
- üîí **Security & Reliability**: 100% test coverage ensures predictable and robust behavior.
- üîß **Extensibility & Maintainability**: A modular architecture that facilitates ongoing improvements and customizations.

Modern development tools such as SwiftLint and swiftformat are part of our workflow, ensuring a clean, 
consistent codebase that is both developers-friendly.
